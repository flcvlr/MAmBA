Installation notes:
MAmBA is a wrapper bash script which implements a pipeline for the analysis of 5mC in microRNAs.
MAmBA can be run on linux and requires the following softwares:

cutadapt 2.0 or later  
bowtie2 
tophat2
GNU parallel
R
bisRNA R package
Samtools v 1.0 or later
bedtools v 2.26.0 or later
pigz

you will also need a local copy of a bowtie2 index for Homo sapiens (hg38) or Mus musculus (mm10).
The path to the bowtie2 index basename should be provided with the -i option when running MamBA.
MAmBA (and tophat2 invoked by MAmBA) expects a corresponding fasta file with the same basename in 
the same directory of the bowtie2 index. In case this is missing, MAmBA and tophat will create their own.
However, this will increase MAmBA running time. In case you want to analyse several samples you can
easily generate the fasta file by running in terminal

bowtie2-inspect /path/to/your/bowtie2index/basename > /path/to/your/bowtie2index/basename.fa


To run MAmBA you should have fastq files obtained by NGS sequencing of bisulfite treated small RNAs.
Furthermore, MAmBA assumes (but does not check) that your library is stranded (second-strand).
This is the case for the vast majority of the small RNA-seq protocols on ILLUMINA, in case you are not 
sure check the library preparation protocol before running MAmBA.

Provided that you have installed the above mentioned softwares, just download MAmBA tarball, 
extract it to a suitable folder in your file system. MAmBA consists of two executable wrapper
bash scripts: 

mamba.sh 		to remove adapters, check bisulfite conversion efficiency, align on the genome and
			summarize 5(h)mC rate at each position. This script will yield tab-delimited summary of 
			5(h)mC frequency at each microRNA as well as a methylation profile for each pre-microRNA in
			.png format

mamba_reference.sh 	to build annotation data for MAmBA for your favorite species

running each script with -h option and no arguments will provide detailed information on Usage.


Testing MAmBA:

hsa annotation and sample fastq.gz files for testing can be downloaded here: https://sites.google.com/a/uniroma1.it/valeriofulci-eng/software
extract hsa annotation in the MAmBA directory along with the sample files, then run the following commands:

./mamba.sh -a TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG -s hsa -o S1 -f sample_1.fq.gz -i /path/to/hg38/bowtie2index/basename -j 8 -n S1  -c GTCGATACCTCACATTAGATC -l log -C red

./mamba.sh -a TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG -s hsa -o S2 -f sample_2.fq.gz -i /path/to/hg38/bowtie2index/basename -j 8 -n S2  -c GTCGATACCTCACATTAGATC -l log -C blue


you should end up with two directories (S1 and S2) each containing a summary ("Summary_report.txt") tab delimited file
with all data on the different C residues tested. Methylation profile figures for some miRNAs are in the subfolders
 "images/mathylated" and "images/non_methylated".
